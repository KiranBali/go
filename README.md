Yoti Golang SDK
=============

Welcome to the Yoti Golang SDK. This repo contains the tools you need to quickly integrate your golang back-end with Yoti, so that your users can share their identity details with your application in a secure and trusted way.    

## An architectural view
To integrate your application with Yoti, your back-end must expose a GET endpoint that Yoti will use to forward tokens.
The endpoint can be configured in Yoti Dashboard when you create/update your application.

The image below shows how your application back-end and Yoti integrate in the context of a Login flow.
Yoti SDK carries out for you steps 6, 7 ,8 and the profile decryption in step 9.

Yoti also allows you to enable user details verification from your mobile app by means of the Android (TBA) and iOS (TBA) SDKs. In that scenario, your Yoti-enabled mobile app is playing both the role of the browser and the Yoti app. By the way, your back-end doesn't need to handle these cases in a significantly different way. You might just decide to handle the `User-Agent` header in order to provide different responses for web and mobile clients.

## Installing the SDK (Preview)
To install this SDK during the preview stage you will first need to clone this repository to the following location:
```
$GOPATH\src\github.com\lampkicking\yoti-sdk-server-go
```

Where `$GOPATH` is the GOPATH variable. See more about this [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH).

## Installing the SDK (Non-Preview)
To import the Yoti SDK inside your project after the preview stage has finished, simply run the following command:

```
go get "github.com\lampkicking\yoti-sdk-server-go"
```

## Including the SDK in your project
You can reference the project in your project by adding the following import:
```golang
import "github.com/lampkicking/yoti-sdk-server-go"
```

## Client initialisation
The YotiClient is the SDK entry point. To initialise it you need include the following snippet inside your endpoint initialisation section:
```golang
sdkID := "your-sdk-id";
key, err := ioutil.ReadFile("path/to/your-application-pem-file.pem")
if err != nil {
	// handle key load error
}

client := yoti.YotiClient{
	SdkID: sdkID,
	Key: key}
```
Where:
* `sdkID` is the sdk identifier generated by Yoti Dashboard when you create your app. _Note this is not your Application Identifier which is needed by your clientside code_
* `path/to/your-application-pem-file.pem` is the path to the pem file your browser generates for you, when you create your app on Yoti Dashboard.


## Profile retrieval
When your application receives a token via the exposed endpoint (it will be assigned to a query string parameter named `token`), you can easily retrieve the user profile by adding the following to your endpoint handler:

```golang
profile, err := client.GetUserProfile(yotiToken)
```

Before you inspect the user profile, you might want to check whether the user validation was successful.
This is done as follows:
 
```golang
profile, err := client.GetUserProfile(yotiToken)
if err != nil {
    // handle unhappy path
}
``` 

## Handling users
When you retrieve the user profile, you receive a userId generated by Yoti exclusively for your application.
This means that if the same individual logs into another app, Yoti will assign her/him a different id.
You can use such id to verify whether the retrieved profile identifies a new or an existing user.
Here is an example of how this works:

```golang
profile, err := client.GetUserProfile(yotiToken)
if err == nil {
	user := YourUserSearchFunction(profile.ID)
	if user != nil {
		// handle login
	} else {
        // handle registration
    }
} else {
    // handle unhappy path
} 
``` 
Where `yourUserSearchFunction` is a piece of logic in your app that is supposed to find a user, given a userID. 
No matter if the user is a new or an existing one, Yoti will always provide her/his profile, so you don't necessarily need to store it.

The `profile` object provides a set of attributes corresponding to user attributes. Whether the attributes are present or not depends on the settings you have applied to your app on Yoti Dashboard.
